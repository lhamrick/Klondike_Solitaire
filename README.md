Klondike Solitaire Project:
----------
>This app is an implementation of the klondike style solitaire using Swift 3 in Xcode. It's implementation adheres to the MVC model type and uses Core Animation Layers to place and render the cards in specific spots. Using layers in this fashion allowed me to check for collisions of the frames in order to check in my model if that collision was correct, which meant I could transfer the card from one region to another (e.g. Move a card from the waste pile to the tableau). It also uses touch responses to dictate where the user touched on the screen.

>3. cd into folder
>4. Open Xcode and navigate to the project using file->open
>5. Once project loads into Xcode, hit the "play/build" button in the upper left cornerin order to build and run the program. (NOTE: If using the encs lab computers, make sure to run /etc/devme, /etc/homeme, and /etc/simme in order to use the similators within Xcode)
>6. Project will load after a successful build and will be usable within the Xcode similator
